All three attacks relied on injecting a malicious payload (detailed differences below) that executes in the victim’s
browser within the security context of the vulnerable web application.
 The payload accessed the `document.cookie` object to read the victim’s session cookie and used the browser’s
`fetch` API to send an HTTP request to an attacker-controlled server, embedding the stolen cookie as a URL parameter.
we implemented servers that listen for incoming HTTP requests generated by the payload,
extract the PHPSESSID value for example in case of reflected, and reuse it to perform authenticated HTTP requests to
the vulnerable web application. The responses are saved to output files.

The difference between the attacks lies in the injection and execution vector of the payload:
DOM-based XSS attack - the payload was injected into a client-side script and
executed dynamically through unsafe DOM manipulation.
Stored XSS attack - the payload was persistently stored in the application’s database 'mariadb' via a crafted
HTTP POST request and executed whenever a user viewed the affected page.
Reflected XSS attack -  the payload was included in a request parameter and immediately reflected in
the server’s HTTP response.

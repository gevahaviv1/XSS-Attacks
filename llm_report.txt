LLM Usage Report - Exercise 3 (XSS)

Tools Used:

Gemini 2.0 Flash (via Web): Used as a study partner to understand the assignment requirements, the network architecture, and the theoretical differences between the XSS types.

Windsurf (Claude 3.5 Sonnet): Used as the primary coding assistant for generating C boilerplate code and constructing URL-encoded payloads.


How the LLMs were used:

Debugging: I prompted the LLM to ensure all code complies with -Wall -Wextra -Werror -Wconversion to avoid point deductions.
